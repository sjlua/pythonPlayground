## Description
Started in 2024, this is a collection of python programming for random functions I wanted to simplify my life, particularly for my CS course... Or just random hobby functions that I wanted to test out.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Python 3.11+, currently tested on Python 3.12.4
* An IDE or an application such as Visual Studio Code, VSCodium or PyCharm.

### Installation

* Download the zip.
* Unzip the package.
* 'Open folder' in VSCode/IDE of your choosing.

### Executing program

* Open VSCode/IDE/folder containing the script.
* Click on the python script you want to run.
* Click the triangle 'run' button in the top right (VSCode).

```
Run in your IDE/application of choice.
```

## Help

This is a beginner's project, not much help can be given at all :') Also, I am not liable if any of the calculations are incorrect. Please make sure to do your own testing too.
